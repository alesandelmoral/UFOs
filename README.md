# UFOs

# Overview of the proyect

The main purpose of this proyect is building an HTML page using JavaScript, boostrap for it, with this the page will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. For this specific proyect we'll use different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.-- based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting to filter the data base. 

# HTML page and results

Once entering the website our client will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have(which is in the image below). From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

# Summary

We have already create a good page that allows to filter the data about UFOs, but one drawback about our search that I noticed is that the users of this page will have to many criteria for filtering but we don't know the source of information, this could be a good plus in our page to give the user the opportunity to go deeper into an specific event.
 My two recommendations for improving this website are:

1. Have more data that has more information including the source of each event that our data has. 
2. The information is constantly changing, an for this it could be a better idea to have a site that would be constantly updating our data adding new sitings to our page.
